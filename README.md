# Collaborate - Question & Answer Site

This is a basic collaboration site built using Rails 4.0.2, Devise, and Foundation 5.

### Author:  Doug MacDowell

### Installation

TBD - *This is a work in progress for a Rails programming class.*

## Usage

To view the questions and answers, users must first register by clicking the __Sign Up__ button in the title bar.

Once logged-in, the __Go To Questions__ button will take the user to the Listing of current questions and answers. From there, a user can add a question, edit an existing question or answer, and delete questions.
